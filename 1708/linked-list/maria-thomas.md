## Student: Maria and Thomas
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- well done!
- JS was _very_ verbose in areas (specifically around appending the cards to the DOM). Refactoring would drastically reduce the number of lines of code and increase clarity/legibility
- well crafted CSS and HTML
- overall, code is well crafted and carefully considered. It is clean, and well thought through.
