## Student: Brandon and Jesse
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- Team embraced the struggle, overcame speed-bumps and frustrations, and came out the other side with a good project.
- good approaches for how they approached and worked through problems/struggles. Didn't just settle on first idea, pushed through to really understand the problem and weren't afraid to get rid of code that wasn't helping them and start fresh.
- GOOD JOB!
- code is ready for a refactor pass (which is a good place to be)
