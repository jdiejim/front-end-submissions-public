## Student: Matt A and Todd
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- Code was a little rough and could use a refactor.
- solid effort, group hit some sticky spots but worked through them and came out the other side with a good project.
- still seem a bit soft on fundamentals, keep practicing to really lock in syntax and build a really solid foundation!
- Good work
