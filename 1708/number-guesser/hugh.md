## Student: Hugh
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- good work pushing through functionality
- design choices made to accommodate extensions in functionality were not user friendly making it unclear and difficult to understand how to use the app
- overall, solid effort! Code could use some clean up and tidying, which is what we expect for this first project.

## Functional Expectations

* Exceptional: Application meets all of the expectations of phase three and one or more of the extensions.
