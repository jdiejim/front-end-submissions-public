## Student: Jesse and Matt R
## Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
## Notes/What To Work On:

- Functionality - All 3 phases completed - HOORAY!!

- Good work w/following:
	Nice work having no deep-nested if/else statements, removing anon functions that aren't necessary, and no global variables. YAY for ARIA!! Nice color button and UX touches (cursor changes and coloring for buttons). Love that you're using Waffle/issues for project management! Good naming for feature branches and commits.

- Room for improvement w/following:
	Set properties of id, importance, and completed should be defaults in constructor. You should not be instantiating new Cards when pulling from local storage or appending cards like in lines 63, 112, and 200 as any one unique card object should only be instantiated once. Lines 265-308 could be refactored into one single, dynamic function. Upvote/downvote could also be refactored into one dynamic function.
