## Student: Jeff and Thomas
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- a lot of redundancy and duplication in CSS. Sloppy CSS.
- obvious that JS took a priority and was what they were most interested in it
- lots of interesting approaches and solutions in JS
- UI redesign is not effective. Needs a lot of work and tidying.
- Mind the details: spacing and indentation inconsistencies need to be caught before you push to master.
