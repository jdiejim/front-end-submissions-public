## Student: Brandon and Julie H
## Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
## Notes/What To Work On:

- Missing functionality w/some extras: 
	App shows more than the last 10 completed todos (part of phase 3) but YAY for character count functionality extension in Task input!

- Good work w/following: 
	Majority of refactoring - getting rid of anon functions, no deep-nested if/else statements, no global variables, and concise functions. CSS file neatly organized with very few areas that could be refactored. Discovering (and implementing) ternary operators. Doing a DTR and respecting each other's learning goals - sounded like the pairing went well!

- Room for improvement w/following:
	Indentation/nesting/spacing in HTML. DRYing up code so that multiple functions/event listeners associated with showing cards based on importance work as a single, dynamic function (225-278). Same with edit title/edit body functions. Commenting between each event listener in JS file makes it harder to read.
