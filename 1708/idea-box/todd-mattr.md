## Student: Todd and Matt R
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- no search or up/down vote, filtering, or localStorage implemented
- ideas are appended to the page
- team embraced the struggle and didn't just pair their way through the project (ie didn't rely on peers or mentors to pull them through more features than they understood how to implement).
- They worked together to focus on learning goals and understanding the code they wrote

## Functional Expectations

* Novice	Application meets all of the basic functional expectations of create, edit, delete, persist in local storage.
* Advanced Beginner	Application allows for upvote/downvote and enables searching/filtering as defined in the spec.


## HTML

## Accessibility

* Novice	Knows what a semantic tag is and leverages the HTML5 structural tags to organize the content of their markup.
* Advanced Beginner	Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.

## Style

* Novice	Crafts markup with proper indentation and opening/closing tags.
* Advanced Beginner	Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting.


## CSS

## Structure of Code

* Novice	Can effectively target DOM elements via tag, class, and/or id and write CSS rules around each element to create the desired style.
* Advanced Beginner	Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.


## Implementation

* Novice	Can articulate how the CSS box model works and apply it appropriately in a static layout.
* Advanced Beginner	Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.


## JAVASCRIPT

## Data Types

* Novice	Can articulate the definitions of primitive data types: strings, booleans, numbers, null, and undefined. Can articulate and describe object types: objects, arrays.
* Advanced Beginner	Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.


## Conditional Logic

* Advanced Beginner	Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is “truthy” and “falsey” in JavaScript.
* Proficient	Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

## Functions & Scope

* Advanced Beginner	Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.


## Arrays

* Novice	Can create array and use array indexing to extract data from array or modify array. Comfortable using arrays to store simple data types: numbers, booleans, or strings.
* Advanced Beginner	Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.


## Objects & Prototypes

* Novice	Can declare an object literal and define/articulate properties vs. methods for an object. Can extract values of an object’s property, and assign new properties and/or reassign values of existing properties on an object.
* Advanced Beginner	Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.

## DOM Manipulation

* Novice	Can articulate what the DOM is and can effectively target elements in vanilla JavaScript via class, id, or tag.
* Advanced Beginner	Can add event listeners and create small functions that execute on events, can leverage the event object appropriately, and can articulate the what/why/how of jQuery.


## Style

* Novice	Can explain the choices made in the overall codebase and is able to articulate what every line of code is doing. Code is neatly formatted and easy to read with correct indentation.
* Advanced Beginner	Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.


## GIT & GITHUB

## Git

* Proficient	Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.


## Github

* Proficient	Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.



## DESIGN

## Comp Recreation

* Advanced Beginner	Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.
* Proficient	Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.



## PAIRING

## Collaboration

* Proficient	Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.
