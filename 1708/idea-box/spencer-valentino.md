## Student: Spencer and Valentino
## Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
## Notes/What To Work On:

- Merge conflicts that were not resolved with functional JS and updated CSS split onto two separate Git repos
- Filter working but full functionality not implemented for upvote/downvote
- YAY ARIA!!!!!!
- Practice explaining/understanding codebase to each other
- Nice job working around the hiccup from early on. You both had a positive attitude about using this as a learning experience, which was great!

## Functional Expectations

* Novice	Application meets all of the basic functional expectations of create, edit, delete, persist in local storage.
* Advanced Beginner	Application allows for upvote/downvote and enables searching/filtering as defined in the spec.

## HTML

## Accessibility

* Proficient	Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

## Style

* Advanced Beginner	Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting.
* Proficient	Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

## CSS

## Structure of Code

* Advanced Beginner	Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.

## Implementation

* Advanced Beginner	Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.

## JAVASCRIPT

## Data Types

* Advanced Beginner	Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.

## Conditional Logic

* Proficient	Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

## Functions & Scope

* Advanced Beginner	Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

## Arrays

* Advanced Beginner	Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.

## Objects & Prototypes

* Advanced Beginner	Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.

## DOM manipulation

* Proficient	Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

## Style

* Advanced Beginner	Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.

## GIT & GITHUB

## Git

* Advanced Beginner	Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.
* Proficient	Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

## Github

* Proficient	Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

## DESIGN

## Comp Recreation

* Advanced Beginner	Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.
* Proficient	Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

## PAIRING

## Collaboration

* Proficient	Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partnerâ€™s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.
