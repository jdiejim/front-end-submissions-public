## Project Name: CitySnapshot

#### Check In: 3

#### Work done:
* All initially outlined city data has been pulled in and displaying on page (required 3 sep. fetch calls/endpoints)
* City page styling mostly complete
* Started comparison page styling
* Started checklist page 
* Search filter complete, throwing correct slug to fetch calls and routing to correct city page 
* Some more tests added


#### Issues:
* Having trouble figuring out how to give the rendered city page a path so it doesn't overlap with home
* Need a little more guidance and time to clean the city data I'm pulling in
* Need help figuring out how to make the search navigate into the results DIV with the up/down arrow key
* Testing actions and reducers is still an issue
* What should I load in from the Google Maps API specifically ?

#### Next Checkin-in
- get testing running 
- polishing the data cleaner so that its working outside 
- putting data into cards 
- compare cities working(ish)
- have the citi list working as well.
