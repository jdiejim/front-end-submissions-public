## Project Name: Geard

#### Check In: 2

#### Project Pitch

Living in Colorado, there are so many adventures to be had outside. The problem is, most of these adventures require expensive gear. There is so much gear that I would love to have, but can't afford. An alpine touring set up for skis can cost well over $1,200, and that is money that I don't have. On the other hand, I shelled out almost $200 for my backpacking pack, and it spends 90% of the year sitting in my basement. What if we could rent the gear we wanted at a reasonable price from fellow adventurers? This is where Geard comes in. Connecting adventurers and explorers alike, users can now rent anything from backpacks to climbing guides, and everything in between.

### Deliverables:

I wasn't given a deliverable for Check In 2, and I don't have much to actually turn in. I have spent my time so far trying to wrap my head around how I am going to organize my data and how to implement node modules to help me accomplish my goals. I think I finally have a handle on how to structure my data. Each user object will have a property that is an array of gear objects that they own called 'forRent'. Those objects will have a property of 'rented' which will be a boolean. Each user object will also have a property called 'renting' that is an array of any gear objects that they are currently renting.

I have started trying to implement Firebase, I have downloaded react-dates from airbnb, set up my react router and gotten my redux file structure set up.
