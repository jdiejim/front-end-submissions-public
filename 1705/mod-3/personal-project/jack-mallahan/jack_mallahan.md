## Project Name: Geard

#### Check In: 1

#### Project Pitch

Living in Colorado, there are so many adventures to be had outside. The problem is, most of these adventures require expensive gear. There is so much gear that I would love to have, but can't afford. An alpine touring set up for skis can cost well over $1,200, and that is money that I don't have. On the other hand, I shelled out almost $200 for my backpacking pack, and it spends 90% of the year sitting in my basement. What if we could rent the gear we wanted at a reasonable price from fellow adventurers? This is where Geard comes in. Connecting adventurers and explorers alike, users can now rent anything from backpacks to climbing guides, and everything in between.
