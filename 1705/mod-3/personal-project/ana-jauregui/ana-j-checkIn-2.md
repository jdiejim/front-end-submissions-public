#### Current status of project:

- I spent quite some time digging through the documentaion for my chosen API and dissecting how I am going to begin working with the data. I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on how to work with it at this point.
- I begin with creating basic create-react-app template and hooked things up to make the initial API call for recipe searching and created some mock-data to try and avoid exhausting limited calls.
- My next step was to implement thunk and try and convert from the basic react app to use Redux... At this point I have reached a bump in the road as I am not getting what I was expecting in the Redux store so I am still trying to work on getting that going in the right direction.
- Once I get things sorted out with my initial calls and Redux showing what I am expecting in the store I will be moving forward to create a basic recipe search and moving forward with the ability to select recipes before I begin to work on more detailed filtered search that you will find as my 2nd iteration of searching.
- I hope to get up and running with that and incorporate styles over the weekend.
