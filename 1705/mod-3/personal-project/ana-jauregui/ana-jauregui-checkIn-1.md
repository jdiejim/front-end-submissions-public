## Project Name:

#### Check In: 1

#### Project Pitch

The app will start as a recipe finder, being able to index by ingredients, type of cuisine, and food restrictions. Once finding a recipe that you would like to follow, it will have the ability to generate a grocery list which can be edited if there are ingredients on the list which you already have. Eventually I would like to incorporate the ability for a user to be able to create an account and log in so that recipes can be favorited/saved and give the user the ability to plan out a menu for the day/week/or month. At that stage after the ability to menu plan I would like to have users be able to think about planning out meals while vacationing with the ability to search for restaurants and reviews in different destinations. In future stages I would also like to give users the ability to share favorite recipes with friends/family and even be able to create their own recipe cards or variations of existing recipes.

#### Order Of Attack

My approach for this project will be to to work in small steps and build out. I will start with working on building out functionality that is familiar to me to solidify what we have been learning throughout mod-3 so far. With each iteration I would like to add a new piece of functionality. I would like each iteration to be a fully functional app that scales in size while incorporating additional API's and grows the stack of tools I am using.  

#### MVP

Application which a user can search recipes through different criteria and be able to generate a grocery list based on chosen recipes.

#### Biggest Challenges
