## Project Name: ConnectME

#### Check In: 1

#### Project Pitch

When you're travelling to a city, the first thing you do is try to think about who you know. Facebook, although a good platform for finding friends in a particular city or messaging one particular person, the two are quite disconnected. Couchsurfing provided us with a good start to finding people in cities to crash with and Facebook provided a good start to finding friends in a particular city. ConnectME will provide a better platform for finding those friends and then messaging them for coffee, dinner, or a place to stay. With this web application, you will be able to search your friend list with a specific city filter and have access to the information while trying to message these people. 

### Deliverables

#### Stack: React, Redux, Router, Firebase, SASS/SCSS

#### APIs: Facebook Graph API, Google map API - pins on the map with users (filter based off of this map)

#### Wireframes: Images in folder

#### Waffle & Github: https://waffle.io/davidbecker6081/ConnectMe, https://github.com/davidbecker6081/ConnectME

#### Order Of Attack: Breaking this out into iterations is going to be important. I think iteration 0 will be getting the api’s set up with initial set up of file/folder structure. Iteration 1 will be to be able to login and logout of Facebook. Iteration 2 will be to search a user’s friend list. Iteration 3 will be to bring in the chat application and send messages to friends. Iteration 4 will be to display users’ locations on the google map. Iteration 5……extensions of some sort. 

#### MVP: I hope to have a multi-page application that brings in functionality of messaging and searching through friends. This application might also have the ability to store lists of friends in a particular city and user sign-in/sign-out functionality. 
Option: user can find one person and connect with and then choose a thing to do around that area or maybe have their info showing up on the map

#### Nice To Haves: Transitions/Animations, A dang good lookin' UI, Possibly yelp api (to find restaurants around area of friend)

#### Biggest Challenges: Creating a smooth flowing UI/UX. Implementing GoogleMaps API and actually taking user data to display on the map

#### Instructor Notes

#### Deliverables for next checkin:

  - Have firebase hooked up to app 
  - setup react, router, and redux 
  - have facebook graph call populate redux store 
      - build container 
      - connect component 
      - store populate with friends 
      - render some sort of friend card 
  - start testing with fetchmock 
  - action tests. 
  
  
  ###Things I've done

wireframing galore!
lots and lots of research
Set up React, Router, Redux
set up testing suite
attempt at making facebook graph API call
container/component is set up and ready to go-ish
a few actions are written for api calls
thunk is set up
store is set up to hold a friends Array
wrastled with Firebase for toooo long (meeting with mentor this afternoon to help)
......wrastled with it again
Instructor Notes


# Deliverables for next checkin:

- Get accesstoken from user 
- start building the chat part
- start tests
